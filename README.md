# Cholesky Decomposition Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Cholesky decomposition algorithm using Python for matrix operations. The frontend is developed using HTML and CSS, and Flask is used for the backend to connect the web interface with the Python code.

## Project Workflow

1. **Cholesky Decomposition in Python**:
    - The Cholesky decomposition algorithm is implemented in Python to decompose a positive-definite matrix into a lower triangular matrix and its transpose.
    - The decomposition is used for solving systems of linear equations, matrix inversion, and more.

2. **Frontend Development**:
    - The user interface is built using **HTML** and **CSS** to allow users to input the matrix.
    - The web form accepts matrix data and submits it to the Flask backend for processing.

3. **Backend Development with Flask**:
    - **Flask** is used as the backend to handle the input from the frontend.
    - The matrix entered by the user is passed to the Python Cholesky decomposition function, and the result is returned to the user on the web interface.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**: For the Cholesky decomposition logic.
- **Flask**: For building the backend web server and connecting the frontend with the Python code.
- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
